LifeTracker – Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Module Focus: Freelancing System & External Account Connections
Document Type: ExecutionIready PRD (Product + System Design)
1. Product Vision & Context
The Freelancing module of LifeTracker is designed to transform freelance work from a reactive, platformIdriven
activity into a structured, reflective, and compounding system. Modern freelancers operate across multiple
fragmented platforms such as freelance marketplaces, code repositories, payment providers, and social networks.
While each platform optimizes for transactions or visibility, none provide a holistic view of the freelancer’s work,
income quality, delivery consistency, or learning over time. LifeTracker positions itself as the central control layer
above these platforms, allowing the user to observe, decide, and improve their freelance operations without
replacing the platforms themselves.
This PRD defines a calm, professional system that emphasizes clarity over automation, reflection over raw metrics,
and longIterm leverage over shortIterm hustle.
2. Problem Statement
Freelancers commonly face the following problems: fragmented identities across platforms, poor visibility into active
commitments, weak tracking of scope changes, inconsistent delivery processes, and little postIproject learning.
Income is tracked emotionally rather than analytically, leading to underpricing, burnout, and repeated mistakes.
Existing tools either focus narrowly on tasks, attempt to replace platforms entirely, or become overly complex CRMs
that freelancers abandon. There is a clear gap for a lightweight but deep freelancing system focused on execution
quality and strategic clarity.
3. Product Goals & Success Definition
The primary goal of the Freelancing module is to provide freelancers with a single source of truth for their
professional client work. Success is defined not by the number of integrations or automated actions, but by
increased clarity, improved delivery confidence, and better decisionImaking. Specifically, the module aims to
centralize freelance identities, structure client and project management, provide lightweight revenue awareness,
and create a feedback loop after every delivery.
4. Target User Persona
The target user is an independent professional such as a developer, designer, consultant, or creator who manages
multiple clients and platforms simultaneously. This user values professionalism, longIterm growth, and mental
clarity. They are not looking for another task list, but for a system that helps them think clearly about their freelance
work. They prefer manual control, minimal interfaces, and insights over dashboards filled with numbers.
5. External Account Connections System
External account connections form the foundation of the Freelancing module. Rather than deeply integrating with
every platform, LifeTracker introduces a tiered approach to account connections that balances usefulness with
complexity and privacy. Platforms are treated as sources of work and reputation, not as systems to be controlled.
Level 1 – Manual Account Linking (MVP)
In the MVP, users can manually link external accounts by providing a platform name, username or profile URL, and
account type (freelance marketplace, payment provider, code repository, or branding platform). This approach
requires no permissions, avoids API maintenance, and immediately gives the user a unified view of their freelance
identities. Each account includes a notes area for platformIspecific strategy insights.
Level 2 – ReadIOnly Metadata Sync (PostIMVP)
In later phases, optional OAuthIbased, readIonly integrations may be introduced for selected platforms such as
GitHub or Stripe. These integrations are limited to highIlevel metadata such as activity counts or payment totals
and never trigger automated actions. Manual user input always takes precedence over synced data.
Level 3 – Advanced Automation (Explicitly Out of Scope)
Deep automation such as contract imports, messaging, or invoicing is intentionally excluded from this PRD. Such
features introduce platform risk, complexity, and shift LifeTracker away from its core value proposition of clarity and
reflection.
6. Core Freelancing Features
The Freelancing module is structured around five core entities: Clients, Projects, Milestones, External Accounts,
and Notes. Clients act as containers for longIterm relationships, while projects represent concrete engagements.
Milestones define deliverables, and notes capture communication, scope changes, and learning.
Each project can be linked to one or more external accounts, enabling platformIlevel analysis without duplicating
data. Revenue tracking is intentionally lightweight, focusing on expected versus received payments rather than full
accounting. Time and effort tracking remain optional and reflective rather than surveillanceIdriven.
7. Typical User Workflow
A typical workflow begins with linking external accounts, followed by adding a client and creating a project
associated with that client. The user defines milestones and deadlines, logs communication notes during the
project, and marks deliverables as completed. Upon delivery, the system prompts a short retrospective to capture
lessons learned. These insights accumulate over time, improving future pricing, scoping, and platform strategy.
8. UX & Design Principles
The Freelancing module must feel calm, professional, and nonIintrusive. The interface should avoid dense tables,
excessive notifications, or aggressive reminders. MobileIfirst design is mandatory, with quick access to active
projects and deadlines. Visual hierarchy should prioritize what requires attention today over historical data.
9. Security & Privacy Considerations
User trust is critical. Manual data entry is the default. Any external integrations must use secure OAuth flows with
readIonly scopes. Tokens are stored securely, and users can disconnect accounts at any time. LifeTracker never
performs actions on external platforms on behalf of the user.
10. Success Metrics
Success for this module is measured through qualitative and behavioral signals rather than raw volume. Key metrics
include weekly engagement with the Freelancing section, project completion rates, number of linked accounts, and
the frequency of postIdelivery reviews. LongIterm success is reflected in reduced context switching and improved
pricing confidence reported by users.
